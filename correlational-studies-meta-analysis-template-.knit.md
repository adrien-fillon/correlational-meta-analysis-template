This is a RMarkdown template for Correlational studies meta-analysis in Psychology, developed by Adrien Fillon (Ph.D. student) and Dr. Gilad Feldman (Assistant Professor). This is integrated and adapted with reference to Lim and Feldman (2020) and Nanakdewa et al. (2020); experimental meta-analysis template (Yeung et al., 2020), a primer of correlational studies (Quintana, 2015) as well as Fillon et al. (2020) Impact of past behavior normality on regret: Meta-analysis of exceptionality effect. The corresponding datafile is "Correlational-Studies-Meta-Analysis-Template.xlsx" (simulated data). 

For your own analysis, please replace "Variables", Analysis" and "Moderator" with meaningful labels of Cells descriptives column heads, Dependent Variables, Moderators column heads and Moderators categories. In the excel sheet, the box in orange are facultative for the simulation or pretest. To replace efficiently, in RStudio, you can click "edit" then "Replace and find" (or Ctrl+Shift+J). Similarly, in Excel, you can click "Home" then "Find & Select", "Replace", "Replace all".
